# kilokai-net

In an effort to learn recent and emerging web technologies, this test bed was created to experiment, acquire new skills, and demo capabilities. It likely serves no purpose to anyone but myself. Information about the libraries and tech ~~being used~~, where to find them, and other general notes can be found below. (Update: I ocassionally update this list with more recent libraries and such that I've been using as a reference for myself, although not used in this project per say.)
